### What I learned

For the scrolling functionality, I used the fullPage JS by alvarotrigo and it is a life saver. I really like it and I will be using it for the next projects that would need a smooth and clean-looking smooth scrolling. I learned about how to style a beautiful minimalistic layout with a mobile-first approach which is something that I wished I did with my previous projects because adding complexity makes it so much easier to make a page responsive as opposed to overriding properties which was a common pattern I saw in a desktop-first development approach. I am very satisfied with the results of this page and I will uilize the concepts I learned here for my future projects.

### Useful resources

- alvarotrigo's documentation for full Page is very comprehensive and easy to follow. - [fullPage JS](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js)
